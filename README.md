# insane-idv-experience.

I decided I was going to play an Identity V ranked match. I was expecting a good lot of people. No. No diversity. 3 Emilys. And me, an Ada. Needless to say, it was eventful. It started off with one of the Emilys (Emily 1) leading the hunter to me. Where I was decoding. I ran away, that Emily got fucking bonked. I saved her twice. What does she do? Pull a pallet down on me and let the hunter hit me before I could move. She dies literally 5 seconds after. I get saved by Emily 2. We decode for a little, The hunter is coming after us. I do a little kiting, Emily 3, gets hit and almost dies like twice. Anyways, I saved Emily 2 because I pay back favours. She dies though. We've got like, 2 ciphers decoded right??Im looking for the dungeon because I know this Emily is SHIT. Hunter is chasing her. What does she do? LEAD THEM TO ME. SHE DOESNT DIE, I DO. SHE HEALS HERSELF FULLY AND HAS THE AUDACITY TO SURRENDER. I never liked any of them.
